			<h2>Does Travel really change People?</h2>
			<p>If you’re like me, you believe that travel can change people. Exposure to the world and those who live in it is often 
			a positive force for change. But, lately, I’ve been thinking about how we oversell just how much travel can change people’s minds.</p>
			<br>
			<p>We often believe travel is some sort of panacea for one’s thoughts about the world and the people in it. Go abroad, 
			get exposed to different cultures, and then, bam, suddenly you’ll have more empathy for people around the globe and 
			stop seeing them as some “foreign, scary other.”</p>
			<br>
			<p>Books upon books about travel expound on the belief “I went traveling and became a better person with a deeper appreciation
			and tolerance for others.”</p>
			<br>
			<p>Travel writing cheerleads this mantra.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And it is often true. But only for some kinds of travel.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I believe any kind of slow, long-term, or service-based travel can change people. 
			These kinds of trips take you out of your comfort zone for extended periods — you can’t just escape back to the resort
			when you want to. After all, we only grow when we push our boundaries, try new things, and unhook ourselves from the comfortable 
			and familiar.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This kind of travel helps us grow because it constantly tests us as we interact with new cultures and unfamiliar situations. 
			It gives us plenty of learning moments and exposes us to people we might not have met otherwise.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Few travelers come back from months — or years — of travel or more service-oriented trips without a deeper appreciation 
			and empathy for our world and the people in it.</p>
			<br>
			<p>But cruises (especially those giant ones that are just theme parks on the sea)? Big group tours? Large-scale resorts? 
			Or weekend jet-setting? I don’t believe any of that really has an impact on people’s thinking.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Think about it. When you’re in a resort, how much time do you spend interacting with locals aside from the ones waiting
			on you hand and foot?</p>
			<br>
			<p>If you’re on a cruise, how much do you get to really experience the local culture in port?</p>
			<br>
			<p>If you’re just three days someplace, how much are you learning? And how much do you push yourself out of your comfort zone?</p>
			<br>
			<p>That’s not to say that these types of travel can’t be the impetus for something deeper, however.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In fact, it was a group tour that turned me onto traveling in the first place.</p>
			<br>
			<p>But that tour didn’t change who I was. Instead, it was the 18 months I spent backpacking around the world that changed me
			(or started to). It was during that time that I pushed my limits, traveled slowly </p>
			<br>
			<p>enough to meet locals, and learned how to navigate the world. Though it’s important to remember that life-changing travel
			isn’t just about a length of time. Two or three weeks somewhere can be enough if you stay put and dive deep. 
			But if you’re trying to see six cities in that time, it’s all going to be a blur.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And, if that’s the only kind of travel you do, then the places you visit are going to be no more than a backdrop to you
			“living your best life,” not a chance for you to learn, change, and grow as a person.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I’m all for people going somewhere….even if it’s to a resort. Because, while that trip might not change their way of thinking,
			it might get them to try something new or different the next time around. It could be the gateway trip to something deeper.</p>
			<p>Not all travel leads to profound change. It doesn’t need to. Sometimes you just need a vacation.</p>
